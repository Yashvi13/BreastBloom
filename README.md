## BreastBloom-Empowering women through early detection: Breast Cancer Prediction Model.


Breast cancer is a common type of cancer that affects millions of people worldwide, and it is important to promote early detection and treatment through regular screenings and self-examinations.
We have made a website for spreading awareness of breast cancer using `HTML`, `CSS`, `Bootstrap` and `Javascript`. Along with this we have integrated a Breast Cancer prediction model to predict the possibility of breast cancer in a person.
